Windows Defender - Allow the OPIOID Wallet

Many times, Windows protection will detect an .exe file as a virus. Please see below on assistance. AS ALWAYS, scan your computer with a reputible virus program.

## You should add `opioid-qt.exe` as an exclusion in Windows Defender
### Locate where you have downloaded and/or extracted the .zip files.
* Note: Check your downloads folder

Please see Windows article:

`https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028485/windows-10-add-an-exclusion-to-windows-defender-antivirus`

#### If you encouter Windows Firewall and/or Defender issues.

1) Open Windows defender and allow the Opioid qt .exe file. 

2) Open Windows Firewall and allow the application. 

3) If this does not work, temporarily turn off Windows Defender and extract the wallet and run. 

** Make sure you are getting the Opioid Wallet from our official Git Hub. **
